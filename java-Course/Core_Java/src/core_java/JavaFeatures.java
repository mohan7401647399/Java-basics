/*

1. **Platform Independent**

   * Java code is compiled into **byte-code**, which runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, so it works on any platform without modification — *“Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA)*.

2. **Object-Oriented**

   * Everything in Java is treated as an **object** (except primitive types), making it easier to structure programs with **classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and poly-morphism**.

3. **Simple syntax**

   * Java syntax is easy to understand if you know C or C++, but it removes complex features like pointers, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance (via classes).

4. **Secured**

   * Java has built-in **security features** such as byte-code verification, exception handling, and the absence of explicit pointers, reducing vulnerabilities.

5. **Robust**

   * Java emphasizes **error handling** and **memory management** (through garbage collection) to make programs reliable.

6. **Multi-threaded**

   * Java supports **multi-threading**, allowing multiple parts of a program to run simultaneously, improving performance in concurrent tasks.

7. **High Performance**

   * Although interpreted, Java uses **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation to convert byte-code into machine code at runtime for faster execution.

8. **Distributed**

   * Java has libraries (like **RMI**, **JDBC**, **JMS**) for building distributed systems and working over networks.

9. **Dynamic**

   * Java can **load classes dynamically** at runtime, making applications more flexible and adaptable.

10. **Portable**

    * Java byte-code is platform-independent and free from hardware-specific dependencies, ensuring portability.
