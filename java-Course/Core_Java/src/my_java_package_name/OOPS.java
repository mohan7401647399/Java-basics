/*
		✅ What is OOPS?
			OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System.
			Java is an object-oriented language, meaning: - We build programs using objects and classes instead of just functions.
			Java is fully based on OOPS.

		Class -> Blueprint
		Object -> Real item from class
		
		* Main Pillars of OOPS*

		OOPS Pillars:
			- Encapsulation (Data hiding)
			- Inheritance   (Reusability)
			- Polymorphism  (Flexibility)
			- Abstraction   (Hiding details)

| Concept          | Meaning (Easy Explanation)                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Encapsulation | Keep data safe using private variables + public methods             |
| 2. Inheritance   | One class can use properties/methods of another class               |
| 3. Polymorphism  | One thing behaves in different ways (method overloading/overriding) |
| 4. Abstraction   | Show only necessary details, hide unnecessary ones                  |


	✅ Why OOPS?
		To make code more organized and modular
		To reuse code (Inheritance)
		To hide data (Encapsulation)
		To handle complexity by hiding implementation details (Abstraction)
		To use one name for many forms (Polymorphism)
		Easier debugging, testing, and maintenance


	✅ How OOPS works in Java?
			We create classes → blueprints
			We create objects → real instances       
			Use access modifiers (private, public)
			Use methods, constructors, inheritance keywords, interfaces, abstract classes, etc.
			Enable encapsulation using setters/getters
			Achieve polymorphism using method overloading/overriding
			Achieve abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces


	✅ When to use OOPS concepts?
			You want reusable code
			You're working on large-scale applications
			You need security and data hiding
			You want to follow real-world modeling (like Car is a Vehicle)
			You want your code to be easy to maintain or extend


	🔍 Quick Breakdown of 4 Pillars
		| Concept           | Meaning                                             | Example Use                                  |
		| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
		| **Encapsulation** | Wrapping data and methods together (like a capsule) | `private variables + public getters/setters` |
		| **Inheritance**   | One class inherits properties of another            | `class Dog extends Animal`                   |
		| **Polymorphism**  | Same method behaves differently                     | `method overloading`, `method overriding`    |
		| **Abstraction**   | Hiding internal details, showing only logic         | `abstract class`, `interface`                |



					*****1. Encapsulation - Binding Data + Methods*****

	**Hide internal data and allow access only through methods.**
	Encapsulation is a fundamental OOP principle that bundles data (attributes) and methods (behavior) into a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to internal state. 
	It acts as a protective shield, preventing external code from altering an object's data unexpectedly.


	✅ Why Encapsulation?
		Data hiding: prevents outsiders from directly modifying variables
		Security: you can control what changes are allowed
		Flexibility: you can change internal code without affecting other classes
		Readability: classes become cleaner
		Maintainability: easier to update code or add validation


	✅ When to use Encapsulation?
			You want to protect the data from outside access
			You need control over how data is changed (like adding validation)
			You're writing real-world classes, like BankAccount, Employee, User
			You want to hide complex logic and expose only necessary information


	✅ How do we achieve Encapsulation in Java?
			We use 2 simple rules:
				Make variables private
				Provide public getter and setter methods to read or modify those variables

package my_java_package_name;

public class OOPS {
	private String name = "Mohan";									//	private variable = hidden
	private int age = 29;											//	private variable = hidden
	
	public void setValues(String name, int age) {					// helper method - setter
		this.name = name;											//	set values
		this.age = age;												//	set values
	}
	
	public String getValues() {										// helper method - getter
		return this.name + " " + this.age;							//	get values
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OOPS encap = new OOPS();									//	create an object
		System.out.println(encap.getValues());						//	call method in sysout()
	}	
}





class A {
	private String name = "jack";
	private int age = 29;

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public void setAge(int age) {
		this.age = age;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return this.name;
	}

	public int getAge() {
		return this.age;
	}
}

class OOPS {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		A a1 = new A();
		System.out.println(a1.getAge());
		System.out.println(a1.getName());
		a1.setName("R Mohan");
		a1.setAge(30);
		System.out.println(a1.getName());
		System.out.println(a1.getAge());
	}
}



					*****2. Inheritance – One Class Inheriting Another*****

	✅ What is Inheritance?
		Java Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from an existing class. 
		This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

		Parent class = superclass
		Child class = subclass

	* we cannot inherit private, block and constructor
	* we can inherit variables and methods
	* Five types of inheritance available -> single, multi, hierarchical, multiple, hybrid
	* multiple and hybrid inheritance not support using class*



	✅ Why Inheritance?
		Main objectives:
			Reusability – No need to write same code again
			Readability – Organizes classes in a logical hierarchy
			Maintenance – Update code in one place (parent class)
			Extensibility – Easily add new features by extending existing class

	
	✅ When to use Inheritance?
			Two classes have common features
			You want to create a general-to-specific hierarchy (e.g., Vehicle → Car → SportsCar)
			You want to extend functionality of an existing class without changing its code
		⚠️ Try to avoid inheritance when:
			Classes are unrelated
			Only for reuse (sometimes composition is better)


	✅ How does Inheritance work in Java?
		We use the keyword extends for classes.

		class Animal {
			void eat() {
				System.out.println("Animal eats");
			}
		}

		class Dog extends Animal {
			void bark() {
				System.out.println("Dog barks");
			}
		}

		public class Test {
			public static void main(String[] args) {
				Dog d1 = new Dog();
				d1.eat();   // inherited
				d1.bark();  // own method
			}
		}


		Types of inheritance in Java:

			Single inheritance (A → B)
			Multilevel inheritance (A → B → C)
			Hierarchical inheritance (one parent → many children) (B -> A & C -> A )
			Multiple inheritance
			Hybrid inheritance
			👉 Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes (to avoid confusion), but it can be done using interfaces.

							i. single level - One subclass --> one Superclass/parent class
	* One class inherits from another class is known as single level inheritance

package my_java_package_name;

class Hotels{
	public String name ="Taj";
	void dish() {
		System.out.println("Hotel name is " + name);
		System.out.println("Dishes methods are available in the hotel class");
	}
}

public class OOPS extends Hotels {
	public int price = 50000;
	void items() {
		System.out.println(name + "food price is " + price);
		System.out.println("Extra one items methods are available in the OOPS class using extends keyword");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OOPS inheritance = new OOPS();									//	create an object
		inheritance.dish();
		inheritance.items();
	}	
}




						ii. Multilevel - chain of inheritance
		* A class inherit from another class, that class inherit from another
							class is known as multi-level inheritance

package my_java_package_name;

class Restaurant{
	public String place ="India";
	void locate() {
		System.out.println("Restaurant located in " + place);
		System.out.println("Restaurant class");
	}
}

class Hotels extends Restaurant{
	public String name ="Taj";
	void dish() {
		System.out.println("Hotel name is " + name);
		System.out.println("One more datas available from Restaurant class + Dishes methods are available in the hotel class");
	}
}

public class OOPS extends Hotels {
	public int price = 50000;
	void items() {
		System.out.println(name + "food price is " + price);
		System.out.println("Extra one items methods are available in the OOPS class using extends keyword");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OOPS inheritance = new OOPS();									//	create an object
		inheritance.dish();
		inheritance.items();
		inheritance.locate();
	}	
}




							iii. hierarchical inheritance - Multiple subclasses -> one superclass/parent class
	* Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class is known as hierarchical inheritance.

package my_java_package_name;

class Restaurant{
	public String place ="India";
	void locate() {
		System.out.println("Restaurant located in " + place);
		System.out.println("Restaurant class");
	}
}

class Hotels extends Restaurant{
}

public class OOPS extends Restaurant {
	public int price = 50000;
	void items() {
		System.out.println("Restaurant located in " + place);
		System.out.println("Parent class data are available in the OOPS class using extends keyword");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OOPS inheritance = new OOPS();									//	create an object
		inheritance.items();
		inheritance.locate();
	}	
}





							iv. Multiple inheritance - Mulitple classes using interface

		* If a child class is having more than one parent is known as multiple inheritance. 
		* Multiple inheritance is not possible by using class, but multiple inheritance is possible by using interface


package my_java_package_name;

	interface A {
		void show();
	}
	interface B {
		void display();
	}
	class C implements A, B{
		public void show() {
			System.out.println("A interface with show method");
		}
		public void display() {
			System.out.println("B interface with display method");
		}
	}
	
	public class OOPS {
		
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		C multipleInhertiance = new C();							//	create an object
		multipleInhertiance.show();									//	call method
		multipleInhertiance.display();								//	call method
	}	
}




					v. Hybrid Inheritance = Combination of more than one type of inheritance.

		 * Examples -> Single + Hierarchical or Multilevel + Multiple
		 * Hybrid = Interface + Class Inheritance

package my_java_package_name;

interface A{
	void show();
}
interface B{
	void display();
}
class C{
	void greet() {
		System.out.println("C class");
	}
}

//Hybrid: inherits from Base + implements multiple interfaces
class OOPS extends C implements A, B {
	
	public void show() {
		System.out.println("show method");
	}
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("display method");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OOPS hybridInheritance = new OOPS();
		hybridInheritance.show();
		hybridInheritance.display();
		hybridInheritance.greet();
	}
}





					*****3. Polymorphism – One Name, Many Forms*****

	✅ What is Polymorphism?
		* Polymorphism means "many forms".
		* Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take many forms specifically,
				- in Java, it means that a method can have the same name but different implementations is known as polymorphism.


	✅ Why Polymorphism?
		Flexibility and dynamic behavior
		Use one interface, many implementations
		Helps in code reusability and readability
		Enables powerful concepts like dynamic method dispatch (runtime decision)


	✅ When to use Polymorphism?
			You want same function name to do different tasks
			You’re designing general to specific classes (like shapes, animals, etc.)
			You want to write loose-coupled and flexible code
			You want your functions to use parent type reference to call child object methods
				Animal a = new Dog();  // parent reference, child object
				a.sound();             // runtime polymorphism


	✅ Types of Polymorphism in Java
		* In Java we have 2 types of polymorphism:
				1. Compile time polymorphism(or)static binding (Method Overloading).
				2. Run time polymorphism(or)dynamic binding (Method Overriding).

	✅ How do we implement Polymorphism?
		* Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):
			1. This occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number, type, or order of arguments).
			2. The correct method to be executed is determined by the compiler based on the arguments passed during the method call.
			3. Example: Having multiple add methods in a class, one for integers (add(int a, int b)) and another for doubles (add(double a, double b)).


a. Method Overloading (same name, different parameters)

package my_java_package_name;

public class OOPS{
	
	void add(int a, int b) {
		System.out.println(a + b);
	}
	void add(double a, double b) {
		System.out.println(a + b);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OOPS intNums = new OOPS();
		intNums.add(5, 2);
		intNums.add(2.5, 5.1);
	}
}


			* Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):
				* This occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
				* The method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual object type being referred to by the reference variable (Dynamic Method Dispatch). 
				* This typically involves using the @Override annotation for clarity and compiler checks.
				* Example: A Shape class with a draw() method, and Circle and Square subclasses that override draw() to provide their specific drawing logic. A Shape reference variable holding a Circle object will call Circle's draw() method at runtime.


b. Method Overriding (child class changes parent method)

package my_java_package_name;

class Animal{
	void sound() {
		System.out.println("Animal make a sound");
	}
}

class OOPS extends Animal{
	@Override
	void sound() {
		System.out.println("OOPS make a sound");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OOPS p1 = new OOPS();							//	polymorphism
		p1.sound();										//	call subclass method
	}
}




class A {
    void add() {    // original method
        System.out.println("add method called");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    @Override
    void add() {    // overridden method
        System.out.println("add method rewrite");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A obj = new B();   // upcasting: parent reference, child object
        obj.add();         // will call overridden method in B
    }
}



					*****4. Abstraction – Hiding Details, Showing Only Essentials *****
	✅ What is Abstraction?
			* Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary implementation details and providing the essential features of an object.
			* Abstraction hides the “how” and shows only “what”.
			* We can achieve abstraction by using abstract class or interface.

	✅ Why Abstraction?
			* In Java, the abstract keyword is used with classes and methods to define incomplete structures that must be implemented by subclasses.
			* It’s a key part of abstraction and inheritance in object-oriented programming.

	✅ When to use Abstraction?
		You want to define a common template/skeleton for classes
		You want to force child classes to implement certain methods
		You need loose coupling and flexible code design
		You are designing frameworks or base classes


		* Key rules:- 
			1. Abstract method don't have a body.
			2. Abstract method only inside the abstract class.
			3. Abstract class have a constructor.
			4. Abstract class have a methods.


	✅ Real-world Example:
		ATM Machine – You only press buttons, but you don’t know internal code or logic.
		Mobile phone – You use features without knowing how they’re built inside.


* Method - 01 *
package my_java_package_name;

abstract class Vehicle{
	abstract void start();									//	abstract method - no body
}

class OOPS extends Vehicle{
	void start() {											//	create the body for abstract
		System.out.println("OOPS class to invoke");
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Vehicle a1 = new OOPS();							//	create an object
		a1.start();											//	call method
	}
}



* Method - 02 *
package my_java_package_name;

abstract class Vehicle{
	abstract void start();									//	abstract method - no body

	void speed() {											//	instance method
		System.out.println("XYZ brand");
	}
}

class Car extends Vehicle{									//	Car class extends vehicle
	void start() {											//	create the body for abstract
		System.out.println("car extends the vehicle class");
	}
}

class OOPS extends Car{										//	Car OOPS extends vehicle
	void start() {											//	create the body for abstract
		System.out.println("OOPS class to invoked");
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car a1 = new OOPS();								//	create an object
		a1.start();											//	call method
	}
}



* Method - 03 *
abstract class A{
    abstract void a1();						//	abstract method
    public void display(){					//	instance method
        System.out.println("display method in abstract class");
    }
    A(){									//	constructor
        System.out.println("A constructor");
    }
}
class B extends A{
    void a1(){
        System.out.println("B class write in A abstract class");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a1 = new B(); //  up-casting parent reference, child class
        a1.display();	//	call method
        a1.a1();        //  call method
    }
}
